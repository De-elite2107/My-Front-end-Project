                        <p>The Ibeto Group easily is one of Nigeriaâ€™s most successful and highly diversified indigenous industrial conglomerates. By the end of year 2011 the Group had recorded 25 years of uninterrupted historic growth.</p>
                        <p>The origin of The Ibeto Group dates back to the auto spare parts city of Nnewi, in the 1970s. At that time Dr. Cletus Madubugwu Ibeto had just started his life as auto spare parts trader. He was motivated by a strong desire to positively touch other peopleâ€™s lives as well as live out his personal dreams.</p>
                        <p>We are pioneers in rural industrialization. Our organization is ably managed by Boards of Directors made up of some of the best minds in their generations, many of whom have achieved outstanding success and leadership in many spheres of life. The policies of the Boards are implemented by teams of competent and versatile professionals.</p>
